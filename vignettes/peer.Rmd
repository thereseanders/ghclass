# Creating a roster of author-reviewer assignments
We recommend randomizing the order of student user names before creating the roster to prevent non-random clusters of students repeatedly reviewing each other's work. 

# Assigning reviews
The `peer_assign` function distributes review assignment to reviewers. It grabs any `.Rmd` and data files (as specified by the instructor) in the author's repository and clones them into a new folder into the designated reviewers' repositories. 

Author files are anonymized simultaneously.
